The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space.

With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) or [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190530091127/https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285))."
